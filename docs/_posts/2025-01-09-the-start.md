## After Advent of Code

One year ago, I participated for the first time in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). I liked it so much that during the past year I [completed all the previous](https://github.com/voberle/adventofcode) Advent of Code years and now with 2024 entered in the 500 stars club.

As I was looking for next hobby project ideas, I came up [this comment on AoC reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hsj69u/comment/m55ut54/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button):

> Maybe you should try creating something bigger though, and see how you like it. A good mid-size project could be a chess engine - because a lot of algorithms and techniques are well documented and a lot of it is AoC like puzzle solving https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page is a good starting place.

Intriguing.. This could indeed be the idea.

I like chess. I play it regurlarly and like to follow big tournaments on YouTube.

Developing a chess engine also has several of the good characteristics of AoC: There is no need to bother with a UI, there is a way to validate the code works, there is a community.

So I decided to give it a try. I don't know how far I will get, I suppose it will be as long as it's fun.

And I will try to document the journey on this blog.
